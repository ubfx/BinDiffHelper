# BinDiffHelper

Ghidra extension that uses BinDiff on your Ghidra project to find matching functions and rename them automatically (BinDiff 6, 7, 8 supported).
Check out the [BinDiff manual](https://www.zynamics.com/bindiff/manual/) to see how it works and how it matches functions / basic blocks. However, with this extension, BinDiff is automated from within Ghidra, so you don't have to diff your binaries yourself.

**Please report bugs via the issue feature on github**

* Communication with the BinDiff 6 GUI to show graphs for the different functions

## How to Install
Either download the .zip-File from the [release](https://github.com/ubfx/BinDiffHelper/releases), if it's compatible to your Ghidra version, otherwise see *How to build* below.

1. Open Ghidra
1. In the **Main Window**: Go to **File->Install Extensions...**
1. Click the +-Button in the top right and select the BinDiffHelper zip file
1. Close the plugin manager. Restart Ghidra to load the new plugin
1. See *Usage* below

## Recommended other tools
* BinExport plugin [binaries](https://github.com/google/binexport/releases) or compiled from [source](https://github.com/google/binexport/tree/master/java/BinExport) for your specific Ghidra version
* BinDiff (https://zynamics.com/software.html)

Without these, you will only be able to import .BinDiff files and not automatically export and diff from your Ghidra project

## Usage
Make sure the plugin is loaded in the Code Explorer by opening a file in Ghidra and in the **Code Explorer** go to **File->Configure**

Click the small plug-icon in the top right:

and make sure the checkbox next to BinDiffHelperPlugin is checked.

## Import external .BinDiff

The corresponding .BinExport-Files need to be in the same Folder.

Open the file you want to import names into in the code Browser, then go to **Window->BinDiffHelper**
![Open BinDiffHelper](https://i.imgur.com/nl5Jino.png)

Use the *Open from BinDiff* button or menu item and select your .BinDiff file.

![Example import](https://i.imgur.com/b9HXm3s.png)

Select all the function names you want to import and click the **Import function names** button in the top right or the menu item.

## Compare between files in Ghidra project
Go to **Window->BinDiffHelper**, make sure there are no warnings concerning BinExport or BinDiff, then click the **Open from project** button.

Select the other file from the tree and click OK.

## How to build
Requirements:

* Ghidra installation (https://ghidra-sre.org) or compiled from source
* Some jdk. There might be certain restrictions depending on how your Ghidra was built and what other plugins you're using. I recommend using [Temurin 21 LTS](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21), as this currently seems to work with both BinExport and BinDiffHelper. 
* gradle (tested with 7.5, 8.10)

### Clone the repository
Recursively clone the repository, as it depends on [BinExport](https://github.com/google/binexport) for the respective protocol buffer definition.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ubfx/BinDiffHelper.git
```

### Build it
You need to set the `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable to the Ghidra installation dir.
If you have different JDKs installed, make sure the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` points to the one your Ghidra installation uses.

The extension will be built for that Ghidra version specifically.

And then go the *BinDiffHelper folder* in your shell and do

```
gradle
```

This will build both BinExport in the respective submodule and BinDiffHelper in the parent directory. There should have been a .zip-File created in the dist directory. Use that .zip File to install according to the instructions above.

## Development / Debugging setup
Sometimes it's useful to be able to debug the extension together with Ghidra, here are some notes on that:

1. Clone and build Ghidra and let gradle create eclipse projects according to the DevGuide
1. Import the projects into eclipse (make sure it has relevant plugins for extension development)
1. Build and install GhidraDev
1. Unpack the Ghidra build and link GhidraDev to it. Maybe have to set `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable
1. Run Ghidra from eclipse and install BinExport extension
1. Create BinDiffHelper eclipse project with `gradle build eclipse`
1. Import it into eclipse and use GhidraDev to link it to the Ghidra build
1. Debug As->Ghidra

When debugging Ghidra with the extension out of eclipse, the extension is loaded into Ghidra automatically (don't go through the usual extension install). However, the plugin has to be enabled in the Code Explorer.
